DESCRIPTION
The peanut sales company McNuts wants to allow its customers to buy its products through a sales system that generates an invoice from two very different models of entities such as customers and peanuts, also wants to be able to add a limited stock of peanut flavors automatically regardless of whether they are different models for each customer so there is no lack in stock and can improve sales of their product, to be able to associate two models that are different and achieve a common goal we used the structural design pattern of adapter generating that customers and peanuts can generate an invoice and finally to be able to manage a specific stock for each customer of peanuts preventing the shortage of others we used the structural design facade.
